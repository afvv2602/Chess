# Chess Project v1

Welcome to the Chess Project! This project is a basic implementation of a chessboard with the pieces correctly distributed at their initial positions. It's a starting point for a full-featured chess game that will be developed over time.

## Features

- **Chessboard Display**: The board is displayed with an 8x8 grid.
- **Piece Setup**: All chess pieces are placed in their correct starting positions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afvv2602/Chess
   cd chess-project

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    -On windows:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate

    -On MacOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate

4. **Install the required dependecies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


5. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    python main.py


## Future Development

- **v2**: Implement movement mechanics.
- **v3**: Introduce basic game rules, like piece capturing and check/checkmate conditions.
- **v4**: Add a simple AI for playing against the computer.
